# Financial Advising Applcation
 
The premise behind this project is to create a general financial application that looks at one’s budget to determine what their future finances will be like. The core concept surrounds the comparison of renting vs buying in the housing market. Preliminary information is needed about the individual’s finances to best gauge what an appropriate amount of money to spend on housing is. With said information gained, a financial analysis can be made over time to see what housing option will be cheaper in the long term. With all the data being presented, another core component is visualizations. The main chart provides a breakdown of finances at different points in the year. Combined with loan calculations the user can see how the details of a loan change with interest with specifics to amortization.
